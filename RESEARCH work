As a newcomer to the field of liquid robotics, this description may not fully capture the depth and complexity of the subject matter. 
It's my first attempt at describing liquid robotics, and there's much more to learn and explore.
This is an initial effort to understand and engage with the fascinating world of liquid robotics. 
I am excited about the opportunity to delve deeper into this field and expand my knowledge and skills over time.I have also attached a PDF along with this.
